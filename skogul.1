.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Skogul is a generic tool for moving metric data around. It can serve as a
collector of data, but is primarily designed to be a framework for building
bridges between data collectors and storage engines.
.sp
These bridges can be simple \- accept data on HTTP, write to influxdb \- or
complex: Accept data on unencrypted http, batch data together, forward it
to a remote skogul\-instance over a password\-protected, encrypted HTTPS
channel, if that fails, write to a local queue and retry periodically.
.sp
To facilitate this, Skogul has three core components:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Receivers acquire raw data
.IP 2. 3
Handlers turns raw data into meaningful content
.IP 3. 3
Senders determine what happens to the data
.UNINDENT
.sp
A single instance of Skogul must have at least one receiver, but can have
multiple. It also, typically, must have at least one handler and sender.
.sp
Senders come in two distinct but interchangeable variants: Storage\-oriented
senders are used to send the data to some external resource, e.g., a time
series database like InfluxDB. Utility\-oriented senders are used to add
logic, such as error handling or duplicating data to multiple storage
systems.
.sp
There are more examples in the the "examples/" directory.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
Configuration of skogul is done with a json config file, referenced with
the \-f option. You need to specify at least one receiver, handler and
sender to make something sensible.
.sp
The base configuration set is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp

.ft C
{
  "receivers": {
    "xxx": {
      "type": "type\-of\-receiver",
      type\-specific\-options
    },
    "other\-receiver...": ...
  },
  "handlers": {
    "yyy": {
      "parser": "json", // other options might come
      "transformers": [...],
      "sender": "reference\-to\-sender"
    }
  },
  "transformers": {
    "rrr": {
      "type": "type\-of\-transformer",

      "type": "type\-of\-sender",
      type\-specific\-options
    },

      type\-specific\-options
    },
    ...
  }
}
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the above pseudo\-config, "xxx", "yyy", "zzz", "rrr", and "qqq" are
arbitrary names you chose that are how to reference that specific item
within the same configuration. The "type" field references what
implementation to use \- each implementation have different configuration
options. You can specify as many senders, receivers and handlers as you
want, and they can cross\-reference each other.
.sp
Upon start\-up, all receivers are started.
.sp
It is valid to have multiple receivers use the same handler. It is also
valid for multiple senders to reference the same sender. It is up to the
operator to avoid setting up feedback loops.
.sp
Two parsers exist: the JSON parser and a Juniper Telemetry protobuf parser.
Only three transformers exists, and to simplify configuration, the
"templater" transformer does not have to be explicitly defined to be
referenced.
.sp
The documentation for each sender and receiver also lists all options. In
general, you do not need to specify all options.
.SH CONFIGURATION DATA TYPES
.sp
Data types are parsed into Go types. In most cases, the the type is self
explanatory (e.g: a "string" is a typical text string, "int" is an integer,
and so on).
.sp
However, here are some examples that might not be obvious.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B HandlerRef
This is a text string referencing a named handler, specified in
"handlers".
.TP
.B SenderRef
A text string referencing a named sender, specified in "senders".
.TP
.B []string
An array of text strings. E.g. ["foo","bar"].
.TP
.B []*skogul.HandlerRef
An array of SenderRef, so similar to the above ["foo", "bar"], where "foo"
and "bar" are senders named in the "senders" section of the configuration.
.TP
.B map[string]*skogul.HandlerRef
This is a map of strings to handler references. For example, { "/some/path": "aHandler",
"/other/path": "bHandler"}.
.TP
.B interface{}
This is a generic "anything"\-structure that can hold any arbitrary
value. Can be any structure or variable, including nested
variables. Used in the data/metadata transformers, among others.
.UNINDENT
.SH SENDERS
.sp
The following senders exist.
.SS backoff
.sp
Forwards data to the next sender, retrying after a delay upon failure. For each retry, the delay is doubled. Gives up after the set number of retries.
.sp
Aliases: retry
.sp
Settings:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbase \- Duration\fP

.TP
.B \fBnext \- SenderRef\fP
The sender to try
.TP
.B \fBretries \- uint64\fP
Number of retries before giving up
.UNINDENT
.SS batch
.sp
Accepts metrics and puts them in a shared container. When the container either has a set number of metrics (Threshold), or a timeout occurs, the entire container is forwarded. This allows down\-stream senders to work with larger batches of metrics at a time, which is frequently more efficient. A side effect of this is that down\-stream errors are not propogated upstream. That means any errors need to be dealt with down stream, or they will be ignored.
.sp

.SH HANDLERS
.sp
There is only one type of handler. It accepts three arguments: A parser to
parse data, a list of optional transformers, and the first sender that will
receive the parsed container(s).
.sp
The valid parsers are "json", "custom\-json" and "protobuf".
The "templating" transformer does not need to be explicitly defined
to be referenced, since it has no settings.
.SS JSON parsing
.sp
If the "json" parser is used , data sent to Skogul will be parsed to fit
the internal data model of Skogul. The JSON representation is roughly
thus:

The "template" is optional, see the "Templater"\-documentation above for an
in\-depth description.
.sp
If the format of the incoming data does not conform to the Skogul JSON
structure it is possible to use a custom JSON parser ("custom\-json")
which puts all the incoming data into the data\-field in the Container.
After this it is possible to apply transformers to process the data further.
.sp
The primary difference between metadata and data is searchability,
and it will depend on storage engines. Typically this means the name
of a server is metadata, but the load average is data. Skogul itself
does not much care.
.SS Juniper Telemetry Parsing
.sp
If the "protobuf" parser is used, the Juniper Telemetry\-specific protobuf
parser is used to decode streaming telemetry from Juniper devices. Details
on how to configure your Juniper device for streaming telemetry is outside
the scope of this document.
.sp
Since streaming telemetry is sent on UDP, you need to also use the UDP
receiver. An example configuration:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
  "receivers": {
      "udp": {
        "type": "udp",
        "address": ":5015",
        "handler": "protobuf"
      }
  },
  "handlers": {
    "protobuf": {
      "parser": "protobuf",
      "transformers": [],
      "sender": "print"
    }
  },
  "senders": {
    "print": {
      "type": "debug"
    }
  }
}
.ft P

.sp
Since the protobuf data is typically nested, you may need to use one or
more transformer before passing it on. However, senders such as the
debug\-sender, HTTP\-sender and SQL\-sender can be used.

.SS Templating
.sp
The templating\-transformer is useful for adding identical fields to all
metrics in a collection. If a template is provided, and the
templater\-transformer is applied, all metrics are initialized with whatever
value the template came with.
.sp
This is inteded for when you are sending multiple metrics that share
certain attributes, e.g, they are all from the same machine and all
collected at the same time. Or they are all from the same data center
or region.
.sp
Templates are shallow. If your metric has nested fields, they will not
be merged with what the template provides. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
  "template": {
    "timestamp": "2019\-09\-27T15:42:00Z",
    "metadata": {
      "site": "naboo",
      "machine": {
        "os": "Debian"
      }
    }
  },
  "metrics": [
    {
      "metadata": {
        "machine": {
          "hostname": "r2d2"
        }
      },
      "data": {
        "something": "blah"
      }
    },
    {
      "metadata": {
        "machine": {
          "hostname": "c3po"
        }
      },
      "data": {
        "something": "duck"
      }
    }
  ]
}
.ft P

Here, the template provides three items: a timestamp, the "site" field and
the "machine" field of metadata. Once transformed, the result will be:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2019\-09\-27T15:42:00Z",
      "metadata": {
        "site": "naboo",
        "machine": {
          "hostname": "r2d2"
        }
      },
      "data": {
        "something": "blah"
      }
    },
    {
      "timestamp": "2019\-09\-27T15:42:00Z",
      "metadata": {
        "site": "naboo",
        "machine": {
          "hostname": "c3po"
        }
      },

        "something": "duck"
      }
    }
  ]
}

Since each metric also provided a "machine"\-field, it overwrote the value
from the template, even if there were no overlapping fields.
